Monday: Part 2

Top-down allocation for this part isn't so hard. 

We also do it at the very beginning. Just like before, if we have enough (or more than enough) physical
registers, we just assign them to the virtual registers (minus r0) like before.

Otherwise, we need to go through line-by-line and determine which registers need to be spilled.

We end allocation by rewinding the file pointer.

Then we just go through again, line-by-line, and call opSimpleTd() like before, since we've determined
which registers need to be spilled. This should conclude it.
