Done with lecture top-down! Let's move to bottom-up.

Unlike before, where we'd first parse regNode properties in one pass
and perform output in the other, we actually do both in one pass.
More specifically, we

1) Parse information about the current line from the regNodes, in order to determine
which registers are spilled/which are allocated to a physical register/which
physical register is used.
2) Perform the fetch operations accordingly (if applicable)
3) THEN perform the actual output of the line the same way as before.
